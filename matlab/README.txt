GENERAL NOTES
--------------

Files and subfolders in the distribution .zip package.

 tl_p1812_matr.m             - MATLAB function implementing Recommendation ITU-R P.1812-6.

 validate_p1812_matr.m       - MATLAB script used to validate the implementation of 
                               Recommendation ITU-R P.1812-6 as defined in the file 
                               tl_p1812_matr.m using a set of test terrain profiles provided 
                               in the folder ./validation_profiles/

 ./validation_profiles/	     - Folder containing a proposed set of terrain profiles for
                               validation of MATLAB implementation (or any other software
                               implementation) of Recommendation ITU-R P.1812-6

 validation_result_log.csv   - Template for reporting final and intermediate results of basic
                               transmission loss computation according to Recommendation ITU-R P.1812-6

 ./validation_results/       - Folder containing all the results written during the transmission loss
                               computations for the set of terrain profiles defined
                               in the folder ./validation_profiles/

 ./private/                  - Folder containing the functions used by tl_p1812_matr.m and validate_p1812_matr.m


UPDATES AND FIXES
-----------------
Version 6.0 (10.02.22)

    - Update to 1812-6 (free-space loss for short distances, terminal clutter loss, upper frequency limit)
    - Update to validation examples (added new validation for frequencies higher than 3 GHz, 
                                     introduced comma instead of semi-column as csv separator)
Version 5.4 (27.05.21)

	- Introduced support for matrix inputs, improved reading and parsing input arguments

Version 5.4 (08.04.21)

	- Introduced location variability for outdoor propagation
    - Introduced alternative method to compute Lbulls w/o using 
          terrain profile (Attachment 4 to Annex 1)

Version 4.1 (28.05.18)

	- Corrected a bug (swap of long and lat coordinates in great_circle_path call, reported by Wladislaw Budynkiewicz.
	- Corrected a bug in printing the values for Lbulla50 and Lbulls50 (scalar and not vector values) reported out by Damian Bevan
    - Corrected a typo in error reporting for hrx
	- Introduced path center calculation according to Annex H of Recommendation ITU-R P.2001-2
	- Re-created validation examples so that they match the new path-center calculation (minor differences of the order 0.01 dB)
	- Created two new validation examples to test for the case of vertical polarization
        - Added function isOctave to ensure compatibility with interactive plotting in Octave
        - Added an error message occuring in the case ./src/ is not on the MATLAB search path
